# ICOM CI-V Implementation Notes

## About the frame

The command frame structure:

```
[$FE][$FE][to-addr][fm-addr]...[$FD]
```

* `$FE$FE` - beginning, `$FD` - end.
* `to-addr` and `fm-addr` are the destination address and the source address.
* The content of the frame is the data (command, subcommand, parametersâ€¦). The data size may be up to 50+ bytes.

The response frame is simular. If responses OK or NG (Not Good), the content should be `$FB` and `$FA`.

There are NO responses for the command `$00` and the command `$01` for communicating speed.

## The basic commands of old rigs

* http://www.plicht.de/ekki/civ/civ-p52.html

This project will implement the commands used by Ham Radio Deluxe 5.24.0.38. The commands used by wsjt-x and by OmniRig will be supported also.

## CatTask Class

The CatTask is implemented based on the following FSM:
